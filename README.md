# &#x1F64B; The Little Man Stack Machine

The Little Man Stack Machine is a simple, theoretical computer model that extends the excellent 
[Little Man Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer) teaching model and that can be used to 
demonstrate many interesting topics in Computer Science in an easy and approachable way for beginners:

* The operations of a basic Von Neumann computer
* How assembly works
* How function calls can be implemented using basic hardware
* How recursion works
* How stack languages works
* How a high-level programming language can be compiled to assembly
